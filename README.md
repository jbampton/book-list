### David Levens

#### Daily Mail Basic Chess

Seen on the cover: "A comprehensive and jargon-free guide to the rules and tactics." A small book with a two column format having a reasonable number
of diagrams. Comprising 240 pages, first published in 2005 and this edition in 2021. On review we found the diagrams in this latest edition to
be slightly harder to read compared to diagrams in some other books. The book is all black, gray and white no other colors. A highlight is the sixty plus questions in the "Test your chess IQ" section.

#### The Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games, 2021 edition

### Andrew Soltis and Ken Smith

#### Pillsbury The Extraordinary

A story about `Harry Nelson Pillsbury` one of the lessor known American Chess Masters who was born in 1872. The book is divided into two parts with the first part the biography written by Soltis and the second part the Games written by Smith. This classic Soltis and Smith mashup works well with a lot of games having diagrams every three moves. In part one there are seven chapters and in part two there are thirty games. Published by Chess Digest, Inc. Small book, 144 pages, 1990 edition.

### Anatoli Vaisser

#### Beating the King's Indian and Benoni - Shock your opponents with the Four Pawns Attack

Most chess enthusiasts would find that this book in The American Batsford Chess Library has way too many moves listed and not many diagrams in between. This International Chess Enterprises (ICE) book published in 1997 is typical of the hard work approach of the author Grandmaster Anatoly Vaisser who is known to be one of the best senior players.
